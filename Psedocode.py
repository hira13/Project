#Get Data of Endangered or higher level chordate species around the world 
	#use the website scaper (what we learnt last wee) to get this information 
	#Write a script to narrow down what type of chordate you want to look at 
	#Script to get the type of threat/conservation that is present to this 1 type of species 
	#Script to sort the type of threat/conservation method by category for all types of species 
	#get total number of threats/conservation methods present based on type of threat 
#Graph(what we will learn next week) 
	#Bar graph the most common threats presented to the type of chordate selected 
	#Can also bar graph the most common conservation methods for specific type of chordate species
