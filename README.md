I decided to manipulate data with consistence information like the one on the endangered/threathened animals website. I used the IUNPC website to get a list of endangered species of canidae(dogs).The problem on the IUNCP website is that I can search the species based on everything, but to get the species threat I have to click on the name and then the classification scheme and then get the threat. For this reason I created a dictionary where you can enter the name of the species and immediately get the threat. 

You can also search by threat, or add/append a species as well. 

I compared this list with the smithsonion list to make sure they were consistent. The I used a code to webscape the names from the website of the species, regex and webscrapping. Created a for loop and added the names as a list to another file. Then I compared the urls between the species and noticed that each one had a unique 4 digit urlID code or speciesID. So I made a loop that would add the specific ID to the URL then download the website and search for the species threat numbers and save that. Then I made a dictionary with the species name and threats and made codes that would ask the user for the species name or threat and search the dictionary to give them the result. I also asked if the user wanted to append or add a species in which case it would add the species to the dictionary or update the current one based on the users need. 


I worked very hard on this program and though there are some gliches I am pretty proud of what I did. I never in a million years expected to be able to do everything I said above, but I did. I am greatful for an awesome quarter with you Dr.Alfaro and Jonathan. I've learnt a lot. Thank you!
